                    Enthusiastic budding Web Developer with 7+ years experience with E-Commerce platforms like Shopify and Amazon. Discovering an interest in possibilities of the back-end of the internet of things, I began continuing my education at the Ohio State University. As a self motivated learner, I know the field of Web Development is a natural progression of that. Eagerly driven by results, I focus on detail execution and adaptability to complete complex projects.

The most rewarding experience is the development of our online retail spaces.

                        Naturally a people person, bartending is a delightfully attractive profession. Fast-paced customer service, artful execution a delicious beverages and a meaningful team experience. Boiling down my experience to a few sentences will not lend justice to the work. Experience in high end restaurants like Montgomery Inn at the Boathouse, Trattoria Roma and Palomino, and a few local favorites like The Crows Nest and Barleycornâ€™s. Bartending taught me leadership skills, attention to detail, inventory management and adaptability to a situation.
