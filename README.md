## Description
Using GitHub's page deploy for React,  I was able to create a interactive single page application. While I leaned again on Bootstrap for my styling, I believe that with a few minor tweaks it will work perfectly to show off my accomplishments.

I would like the complete contact form to be in the footer. This will leave it present on all pages to reach out and contact me. So while I know the criteria called for a separate page for a contact form, I felt that the UI would benefit having access to this on every page.
